* It feels like I've been gone for a long time...
* A little exercise: what is Security?
* Terminology: Is it Computer Security?  Is it Information Security (infosec)?  Is it Cyber Security?
* So how far have we come? (or lack thereof)
* The schtick is very different in this course, and this may be the most "different" course you will take in the CS curriculum.
* One outcome of this course: question everything
* What's my ultimate goal for you in this course?  We'll revisit this on the last day of class.
