<body>
<h1>COMP 116: Introduction to Computer Security, Fall 2015</h1>
<h2>The Final Project</h2>
<h2 class="note">Absolute Deadline: Tuesday, December 15th at 6 PM</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We have covered a plethora of security topics in this class.  For the final project in the class, you will delve into a current security issue of your choice.  This is not only your opportunity to specialize on a topic, but also to stand out and gain hands-on experience in the field.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>There is a rich history of past projects in this class including <a href="https://www.andysayler.com/output/pdf/macswap-2600-article.pdf" target="_blank">Network Anonymity Through “MAC Swapping”</a></span> by Andrew Sayler (spring 2011); published in Volume 28, Issue 3 (Autumn 2011) of <span class="tite">2600: The Hacker Quarterly</span>.  An archive of past final projects is available at <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/archive/" target="_blank">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/archive/</a>.</p>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>My hope of this final project is that you will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specialize in a current security issue of your choice</li>
<li>Gain hands-on experience in the field</li>
<li>Demonstrate technical knowledge</li>
<li>Communicate clearly to a community</li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>For this final project, you must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a mentor</li>
<li>Write a paper</li>
