<p>2 (12 points). Authorities recently seized a local resident's computing device.  The person is suspected of stalking a famous celebrity.  An image of suspect's disk on the computing device is available for investigation: <code><a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/disk.dd.zip">disk.dd</a> (3.08 GB compressed as ZIP, MD5 checksum = 90c9cc48771a945e7c17a71213e6880b; 7.95 GB uncompressed; MD5 checksum = e0ba4cd2dc6740add877dfccde8445bf)</code>.  Your job is to conduct a forensic examination of the uncompressed image (thus, unzip file first) and document any evidence to the person's actions.  Please answer the following questions.  For each question, make sure to justify your answer.  None of the questions should require more than one or two paragraphs to answer.</p>

<ol>
	<li>What is/are the disk format(s) of the disk on the suspect's computing device?</li>
	<li>Is there a phone carrier involved?</li>
	<li>What operating system, including version number, is being used?  Please elaborate how you determined this information.</li>
	<li>What applications are installed on the disk?  Please elaborate how you determined this information.</li>
	<li>Is there a root password?  If so, what is it?</li>
	<li>Are there any additional user accounts on the system?  If so, what are their passwords?</li>
	<li>List some of the incriminating evidence that you found.  Please elaborate where did you find the evidence, and how you uncovered the evidence.</li>
	<li>Did the suspect move or try to delete any files before his arrest?  Please list the name(s) of the file(s) and any indications of their contents that you can find.</li>
	<li>Did the suspect save pictures of the celebrity?  If so, how many pictures of the celebrity did you find? (including any deleted images)</li>
	<li>Are there any encrypted files?  If so, list the contents in the encrypted file and provide a brief description of how you decrypted the file.</li>
	<li>Who is the celebrity that the suspect has been stalking?</li>
