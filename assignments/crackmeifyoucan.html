<h1>COMP 116: Introduction to Computer Security, Fall 2015</h1>
<h2>Lab: Crack Me If You Can - The 2015 Password Cracking Contest</h2>
<h2>Deadline: Thursday, October 29th</h2>

<h3 class="note">This lab is worth 3 points + potential bonus.</h3>
<p>Download <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/crackme.txt">crackme.txt</a>.  Using a password cracker of your choice, crack as many of the passwords that you can and answer the questions at <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xNXXGtEWdPJ2Rc6rP_bXqQ_kc2Nkp7BbdR9I6t-IN9A/viewform" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xNXXGtEWdPJ2Rc6rP_bXqQ_kc2Nkp7BbdR9I6t-IN9A/viewform</a>.  Please note that the form is nondescript as I don't want form to be flagged (I've received a few warnings in the past).  Submit your pot of passwords using <code>username:password</code> format for each password that you crack.</p>

<p>Please be sure to keep records of your cracked passwords, including password pot, screenshots, and logs in case you are questioned.</p>
