<title>COMP 116: Introduction to Computer Security - Lab: Scapy</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>COMP 116: Introduction to Computer Security</h1>
<h2>Lab: Scapy</h2>
<h2>Due: Tuesday, October 11th</h2>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Learn how to parse and dissect network packets programmatically (using Python and <code>scapy</code>).</li>
	<li>Write a tool to analyze a live stream or a set of network packets for incidents.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>"Scapy is a Python module created by Philippe Biondi that allows extensive packet manipulation. Scapy allows packet forgery, sniffing, PCAP reading/writing, and real-time interaction with network targets. Scapy can be used interactively from a Python prompt or built into scripts and programs" (from <a href="https://blogs.sans.org/pen-testing/files/2016/04/ScapyCheatSheet_v0.2.pdf" target="_blank">The SANS Institute's Scapy Cheat Sheet)</a>.</p>
<p>Scapy and Python 2.7 are installed on Kali Linux.</p>

<h2>Part 1: Scavenger Hunt (10 points)</h2>
<p>Download <a href="picture.pcap">picture.pcap</a> (131 KB).  It looks very similar to PCAP set 2 from the <a href="lab-pcaps.html">PCAPs lab</a> but a much larger set.  This time, write a program using Python and <code>scapy</code> named <code>reconstruct_image.py</code> to reconstruct the image from the packets.  Your program must:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Decode the image from the packets.</li>
	<li>Determine the type of image that is decoded from the packets (e.g., BMP, PNG, JPG, GIF).</li>
	<li>Save the image to file system with proper image file extension.</li>
</ol>
<p>Assume the input PCAP is named <code>picture.pcap</code> and the output image is named <code>output.IMAGE_TYPE_EXTENSION</code>.  Your program should work for reconstructing the image in <code>set2.pcap</code> from the previous lab.  You are strongly encouraged to use built-in Python libraries.</p>
<p class="note">You are not allowed to use any external Python libraries except for <code>scapy</code>.  No credit if you program crashes or if exceptions are not handled properly.</p>

<h2>Part 2: The Incident Alarm (30 points)</h2>
<p>We have covered a number of network scanning techniques, and you practiced finding sensitive information in PCAP files in the previous lab.  This time, you will apply your knowledge to write a tool that provides notification of incidents via a live stream of network packets or via a set of packets in a PCAP file.</p>

<p>Using Python and <code>scapy</code>, write a program named <code>alarm.py</code> that provides user the option to analyze a live stream of network packets or a set of PCAPs for incidents.  Your tool shall be able to analyze for the following incidents:</p>
<ol>
	<li>NULL scan</li>
	<li>FIN scan</li>
	<li>Xmas scan</li>
	<li>Usernames and passwords sent in-the-clear</li>
	<li>Credit card numbers sent in-the-clear.  Use <a href="https://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/using-snort-to-detect-clear-text-credit-card-numbers/2/26" target="_blank">https://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/using-snort-to-detect-clear-text-credit-card-numbers/2/26</a> for reference.</li>
	<li>Nikto scan</li>
	<li>Someone running <a href="https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan" target="_blank">Rob Graham's Masscan</a></li>
	<li>Other Nmap scans</li>
	<li>Someone scanning for Shellshock vulnerability. For background reading on the Shellshock bug, read <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about.html" target="_blank">http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about.html</a></li>
	<li>Anything pertaining to <code>phpMyAdmin</code></li>
	<li>EXTRA CREDIT: Shellcode.  For some background reading on shellcode and what it is, read <a href="https://morgawr.github.io/hacking/2014/03/29/shellcode-to-reverse-bind-with-netcat/" target="_blank">https://morgawr.github.io/hacking/2014/03/29/shellcode-to-reverse-bind-with-netcat/</a></li>
</ol>

<p>If an incident is detected, alert must be displayed in the format:</p>
<p><code>ALERT #{incident_number}: #{incident} is detected from #{source IP address} (#{protocol or port number}) (#{payload})!</code></p>
<p>Example outputs:</p>
<ol>
	<li><code>ALERT #1: Someone looking for phpMyAdmin stuff is detected from 192.168.1.3 (HTTP) ("GET /phpMyAdmin/scripts/setup.php HTTP/1.1")!</code></li>
	<li><code>ALERT #2: NULL scan is detected from 192.168.1.3 (TCP) (<em>binary data</em>)!</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Your program does not need to support saving the stream of packets to a PCAP file or saving a record of detected incidents.</p>
<p class="note">You are not allowed to use any external Python libraries except for <code>scapy</code> (except for the extra credit).  No credit if you program crashes or if exceptions are not handled properly.</p>

<h2>Running and Using the Tool</h2>
<p>In Kali Linux and assuming you are <code>root</code>, run: <code>python alarm.py</code>.  By default with no arguments, the tool shall sniff on network interface <code>eth0</code>.  The tool must handle three command line arguments:</p>
<ol>
	<li><code>-i <em>INTERFACE</em></code>: Sniff on a specified network interface</li>
	<li><code>-r <em>PCAPFILE</em></code>: Read in a PCAP file</li>
	<li><code>-h</code>: Display message on how to use tool</li>
</ol>
<p>Example 1: <code>python alarm.py -h</code> shall display something of the like:</p>
<pre>
usage: alarm.py [-h] [-i INTERFACE] [-r PCAPFILE]

A network sniffer that identifies basic vulnerabilities

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -i INTERFACE  Network interface to sniff on
  -r PCAPFILE   A PCAP file to read
</pre>

<p>Example 2: <code>python alarm.py -r set3.pcap</code> will read the packets from <code>set3.pcap</code></p>

<p>Example 3: <code>python alarm.py -i en0</code> will sniff packets on a wireless interface <code>en0</code></p>

<p>When sniffing on a live interface, the tool must keep running.  To quit it, press Control-C</p>

<h2>Testing Your Tool</h2>
<p>Your tool must be able to detect the usernames and passwords sent in-the-clear in <code><a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set3.pcap">set3.pcap</a></code> and <code><a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set3.pcap">set4.pcap</a></code> from the PCAPs lab.</p>
