<h1>COMP 116: Introduction to Computer Security, Fall 2015</h1>
<h2>Assignment 4: Technical Risk Analysis</h2>
<h2>Due: Thursday, November 19th at 11:59 PM</h2>

<h4 class="note">This assignment is worth 15 points.  You must work on this assignment individually!</h4>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Perform a technical risk analysis of a vulnerable system.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p><strong>Part I, 5 points.</strong> You should have received an email to use <a href="https://analysiscenter.veracode.com" target="_blank">Veracode's Platform (a.k.a., Analysis Center; https://analysiscenter.veracode.com)</a> to create static and dynamic scans of applications, and to review scan reports.  Create and run a static scan of either (1) the fall 2015 Capture The Flags (CTF) game files under <code>www</code> from <a href="https://github.com/mchow01/Security/tree/master/ctf-f2015" target="_blank">https://github.com/mchow01/Security/tree/master/ctf-f2015</a> or (2) an application of your choice, such as your own iOS or Android app.  Please consult with <span class="stress">Help (the question mark icon on upper-right corner of screen) &gt; Compile your application for a static scan</span> for instructions on how to package your application for submission for static analysis scan.</p>

<p><strong>Part II, 10 points.</strong> While the goal of our CTF game was to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a system (i.e., flags), you also performed a number of activities, not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Penetration testing</li>
	<li>"Ethical hacking"</li>
	<li>Conducting research</li>
	<li>Gathering artifacts</li>
	<li>Interviewing people</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine that you are a managing consultant for a major security company or the Chief Security Officer (CSO) for the company that owned the system, and assume that the business context of the system is critical, perform a technical risk analysis of the fall 2015 Capture The Flags (CTF) system.  That is, you are to apply a general risk management framework (largely taken from Cigitalâ€™s Risk Management Framework).  This framework can be used by managers and software engineers to identify, track, rank, monitor, and understand risks for a project or system.  The output of this activity shall be a table with eight columns:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Column Name</th>
		<th>Information</th>
		<th>Example</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Risk ID</td>
		<td>Sequential identifier for risk</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Technical Risk</td>
		<td>Brief Description</td>
		<td>User authentication to system can be brute-forced.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Techical Risk Indicators</td>
		<td>Evidence of the risk occurring.</td>
		<td>Number of incorrect logins for accounts seen in logs; performance of login server has been degrading.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Related CVE, CWE, or OSVDB IDs</td>
		<td>Use comma to separate multiple IDs</td>
		<td>OSVDB-902, CVE-1999-1074</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Impact Rating</td>
		<td>Use NIST standard: (H)igh, (M)edium, (L)ow</td>
		<td>H</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Impact</td>
		<td>Possible results of the risk, impacting the goals of the product.</td>
		<td>Increased load on login server; slower performance; possible denial of service</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Mitigation</td>
		<td>Action taken to reduce the probability of the risk actually occurring (or how to actually fix the bug).  There may be more than one way to mitigate a risk.</td>
		<td>Lock out user account on 5 incorrect password tries by setting account lockout flag to true.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Validation Steps</td>
		<td>How do you ensure that risk was mitigated?</td>
		<td>Account lockout flag set for user account on 5 incorrect password tries.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>In practice and in industry, the technical risk analysis table is used to correlate with <span class="stress">business risks</span>.   Your job is to produce a technical risk table for the entire CTF game.  Each of the vulnerabilities that you found in the CTF game should be a technical risk.  If you perform a (Veracode) static analysis scan on the CTF system, it is wise to use the results from the report on your technical risk table.  However, do not rely solely on the static analysis report.  There are numerous additional critical vulnerabilities in the system that were not part of the game directly.</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>For your Veracode static scan, I will be able to view your application and scan results on the Veracode Analysis Center dashboard. Please also push a copy of your technical risks table <span class="stress">in PDF format</span> to your private repository that I created for you in a folder named <code>technical_risk_analysis</code>.  Say that your private repository is named <code>comp116-mchow</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>comp116-mchow/technical_risk_analysis</code>.</p>
