<h1>COMP 116: Introduction to Computer Security</h1>
<h2>Lab: Packet Sleuth</h2>
<h2>Due: Tuesday, September 27th</h2>

<p class="note">This assignment is worth 24 points.  You must complete this assignment individiually, on your own.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Learn how to <span class="stress">read</span> and <span class="stress">dissect</span> files and sensitive information (including usernames and passwords) from packet sets using open source tools</li>
	<li>Work with real network traffic from arguably the world's most dangerous computer network</li>
	<li>Understand the dangers of sending data over an open network unencrypted, "in-the-clear"</li>
	<li>Learn and utilize encoding schemes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You are given four sets of packet captures from two different networks in PCAP format to analyze: two from a network where file transfers occurred, and the other from arguably the world's most hostile network, DEF CON in Las Vegas, NV.</p>
<p class="note">Note: I am not responsible for the contents in the PCAPs from DEF CON.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Download the following PCAP files:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set 1: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set1.pcap" target="_blank">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set1.pcap</a> (151 KB)</li>
<li>Set 2: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set2.pcap" target="_blank">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set2.pcap</a> (4 KB)</li>
<li>Set 3: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set3.pcap" target="_blank">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set3.pcap</a> (64 MB)</li>
<li>Set 4: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set4.pcap" target="_blank">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set4.pcap</a> (64 MB)</li>
</ol>

<p>Open and analyze the sets of data, one at a time, using <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> on Kali Linux.  It is highly recommended that you also use additional open source tools (e.g., <a href="http://ettercap.github.io/ettercap/" target="_blank">Ettercap</a>, <code>dsniff</code>).  In a <code>README.md</code> (Markdown format), please answer all the questions below.  <span class="note">NOTE: I will NOT accept your work if your answers to the questions are in another file format!</span></p>

<h3><code>set1.pcap</code></h3>
<p>1. How many packets are there in this set?</p>
<p>2. What protocol was used to transfer files from PC to server?</p>
<p>3. Briefly describe why the protocol used to transfer the files is insecure?</p>
<p>4. What is the secure alternative to the protocol used to transfer files?</p>
<p>5. What is the IP address of the server?</p>
<p>6. What was the username and password used to access the server?</p>
<p>7. How many files were transferred from PC to server?</p>
<p>8. What are the names of the files transferred from PC to server?</p>
<p>9. Extract all the files that were transferred from PC to server.  <span class="note">These files must be part of your submission!</span></p>
<h3><code>set2.pcap</code></h3>
<p>Scenario: Someone has been covertly sending pictures to another person electronically.  You intercepted communications at a good time and noticed data seemed to be transmitted in-the-clear.  However, the data looks weird for a single picture, unlike anything you have seen before.  Reconstruct the picture that was sent covertly.  HINT: take a look at the last packet and notice the payload data.</p>
<p>10. How many packets are there in this set?</p>
<p>11. To what service or protocol did the sender use to covertly send images?  Briefly describe your answer.</p>
<p>12. Briefly describe how you were able to reconstruct the image from the packets.</p>
<p>13. Who is in the picture?</p>
<h3><code>set3.pcap</code></h3>
<p>14. How many packets are there in this set?</p>
<p>15. How many plaintext username-password pairs are there in this packet set? Please <span class="stress">count</span> any anonymous or generic accounts.</p>
<p>16. Briefly describe how you found the username-password pairs.</p>
<p>17. For each of the plaintext username-password pair that you found, identify the protocol used, server IP, the corresponding domain name if possible (e.g., <code>google.com</code>), and port number.</p>
<p class="note">IMPORTANT NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT LOG ON TO THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USERNAME-PASSWORD THAT YOU FOUND!</p>
<p>18. Of all the plaintext username-password pairs that you found, how many of them are legitimate?  That is, the username-password was valid, access successfully granted?  Please <span class="stress">do not count</span> any anonymous or generic accounts.</p>
<h3><code>set4.pcap</code></h3>
<p>19. How many plaintext username-password pairs are there in this packet set? Please <span class="stress">count</span> any anonymous or generic accounts.</p>
<p>20. For each of the plaintext username-password pair that you found, identify the protocol used, server IP, the corresponding domain name if possible (e.g., <code>google.com</code>), and port number.</p>
<p class="note">IMPORTANT NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT LOG ON TO THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USERNAME-PASSWORD THAT YOU FOUND!</p>
<p>21. Of all the plaintext username-password pairs that you found, how many of them are legitimate?  That is, the username-password was valid, access successfully granted?  Please <span class="stress">do not count</span> any anonymous or generic accounts.</p>
<p>22. Provide a listing of all IP addresses with corresponding hosts (hostname + domain name) that are in this PCAP set. Describe your methodology.</p>
<h3>General Questions</h3>
<p>23. How did you verify the successful username-password pairs?</p>
<p>24. What advice would you give to the owners of the username-password pairs that you found so their account information would not be revealed "in-the-clear" in the future?</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Push your <code>README.md</code> and extracted files from <code>set1.pcap</code> and <code>set2.pcap</code> to the private GitHub repository that I created for you in a folder named <code>pcaps</code>.  <span class="note">PLEASE DO NOT PUSH THE TWO PCAP FILES TO THE FOLDER!</span> Say that your private repository is named <code>comp116-mchow</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>comp116-mchow/pcaps</code>.</p>
