<h1>COMP 116: Introduction to Computer Security</h1>
<h2>Lab: Forensics</h2>
<h2>Due: Tuesday, December 6th</h2>

<h4 class="note">This assignment is worth 15 points.  You must work on this assignment in an assiged team!</h4>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Perform a forensics analysis of a disk.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Authorities recently seized a local resident's computing device.  The person is suspected of stalking a famous celebrity.  An image of suspect's disk on the computing device is available for investigation: <code><a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/data.img.zip">data.img.zip</a> (74.4 MB compressed as ZIP, MD5 checksum = 828ad7f0d7ec4d1933ce570bb583dc81.  The disk image decompressed from ZIP is 838.9 MB)</code>.  Your job is to conduct a forensic examination of the uncompressed image (thus, unzip file first) and document any evidence to the person's actions.  Please answer the following questions.  For each question, make sure to justify your answer.  None of the questions should require more than one or two paragraphs to answer.</p>

<ol>
	<li>What is the MD5 checksum of the disk image?</li>
	<li>What is/are the disk format(s) of the disk on the suspect's computing device?</li>
	<li>What operating system, including version number, is being used?  Please elaborate how you determined this information.  Please provide any screenshots that support your findings.</li>
	<li>Is there a phone carrier involved? Please provide any screenshots that support your findings.</li>
	<li>What applications are installed on the disk?  Please elaborate how you determined this information. Please provide any screenshots that support your findings.</li>
	<li>List some of the incriminating evidence that you found.  Please elaborate where did you find the evidence, and how you uncovered the evidence.  Please submit any incriminating evidence.</li>
	<li>Did the suspect move or try to delete any files before his arrest?  Please list the name(s) of the file(s) and any indications of their contents that you can find.</li>
	<li>Did the suspect save pictures of the celebrity?  If so, how many pictures of the celebrity did you find? (including any deleted images).  Please submit all the images that you have found.</li>
	<li>Are there any encrypted files?  If so, list the contents in the encrypted file and provide a brief description of how you decrypted the file.  Please submit all the decrypted contents.</li>
	<li>Who is the celebrity that the suspect has been stalking?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Please push a copy of your report as a <code>README</code> in either text <code>README.txt</code> or Markdown format <code>README.md</code> to your private repository that I created for you in a folder named <code>forensics</code>.  Say that your private repository is named <code>comp116-mchow</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>comp116-mchow/forensics</code>.  DO NOT COMMIT AND PUSH THE DISK IMAGE IN REPOSITORY! Please make sure two names are on the document.  I will be grading one submission per team.  I hope that both members will have the same document in each repo.</p>
